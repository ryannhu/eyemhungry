## Inspiration

Eye'm HUNGRY is an innovative and immersive gaming project that revolutionizes how players interact with a game through the integration of eye tracking glasses. The project aims to enhance gaming experiences by allowing users to control gameplay elements, navigate the game world, and make in-game decisions using their eye movements and gaze.


## What it does
This games works by harnesses the power of eye tracking technology in the Adhawk Minlink glasses to enable players to control game actions a simple sprite around the screen

## How we built it
The intro website was built using React, we built the game using a game engine called Godot and exported the game to a static HTML website that is linked to the landing page. Lastly, we integrated the glasses control by using the Adhawk API to control and takeover traditional keyboard I/O.

## Challenges we ran into
- The glasses were very inaccurate, so it was very hard to calibrate
- The game was very hard to deploy to HTML because we ran into header issues so we ran the files in a separate python http server
- It was very challenging to work with such unique languages and frameworks for the first time since it was our first time making a game

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We built a functional game!

## What's next for Eye'm HUNGRY
- Integration with the blinking recognition in the glasses
- More game related development
